      <h3>The best care for your plant</h3>
      <p>
      Found your favorite new plant? Time to order her and have her delivered to your home! Every plant is unique and therefore needs unique care. Some plants are easygoing types, but there are certainly some plants that can be a bit stubborn. To give your plant a long and happy life, we recommend that you take a good look at what your green friend needs.
      </p>
      <h6>Light</h6>
      <p>
      You have sun and shade lovers and so do plants! How much light your plant needs depends on the species. For example, some plants can greatly enjoy (in)direct sunlight, but others will be happier with a little shade. Keep this in mind when you are looking for the perfect spot in your home.
      </p>
      <h6>Water</h6>
      <p>
      How much water your houseplant needs differs per species. However, there are a number of factors that you can take into account. Plants need more water under some circumstances, such as with lower humidity (heating/air conditioning), a lot of sunlight, a higher temperature and during the flowering period. In winter it is also a lot colder, so plants need less water.
      </p>
      <h6>Nutrition</h6>
      <p>
      In addition to light and water, your houseplants can also use some extra love once in a while. Occasionally remove all yellow leaves and remove the dry flowers. This makes your plant look prettier and they can put their energy into the living leaves. Your plant will also be very happy with a plant sprayer! Spray the plant regularly to improve humidity, keep the leaves clean and reduce the risk of pests. Finally, we recommend that you give the plant some plant nutrition once every 1 to 2 weeks during the growth period.
